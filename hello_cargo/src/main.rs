// I can run cargo build to compile the code and cargo run to compile and run the code
// $ cargo build

// This generates a binary file in the target/debug directory. You can run this file directly:
// $ ./target/debug/hello_cargo

// You can also use cargo run to compile and run your code:
// $ cargo run

// This command compiles your code, creates an executable, and runs it. The output should be the same as when you ran the executable directly:

// I can also run cargo check to check whether the code compiles without actually producing an executable:

// $ cargo check

// This command is useful if you want to check whether your code compiles but donâ€™t need the executable. It runs much faster than cargo build because it doesnâ€™t produce an executable.

// I can also run cargo build --release to compile the code in release mode, with optimizations:

// $ cargo build --release
